    <p>Children can be enrolled in the first 3 weeks of each term,
      but please feel free to visit the dojo any time and watch a class.

    <p>Aikido is a Japanese martial art that uses strikes, locks, holds, throws, and the opponent’s momentum to fend off
      attacks. Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely
      fall or roll.

    <p>Aikido is the perfect way for children to strengthen not only the body but also the mind and spirit.

    <p>Through structured training, your child will improve their balance, co-ordination and flexibility. It also helps
      them develop good posture, self-confidence, physical and mental discipline, perseverance, personal security and
      self-defence.
