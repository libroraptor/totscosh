    <p>Aikidō Nelson is affiliated with the international Aikikai Hombu Dōjō through Shihan Nobuo Takase, 7th degree
      black belt.</p>



    <p>The dōjō building was built in 1928 as the Tahunanui Town Hall. The land was gifted to the Tahunanui Town
      Board. Original meeting notes from that era are still available to view at the Nelson Provincial Museum. The hall
      was used as a school, a children’s playgroup venue, possibly as an op-shop and then as a dōjō.

    <p>Aikidō started using the hall for training in 1988.

    <p>In 1993, the Nelson City Council sold the land and building to the Baumgartner/Hartman Family Trust. Some major
      renovations and upgrades were made to the hall and the surrounding area and many different martial arts clubs also
      used the hall for training including Judō, Hapkidō and Jujitsu.

      <p>I started aikidō in 1976, in Switzerland. Tada Sensei was a particularly inspiring teacher for me and I was
        lucky to
        have had many amazing role models in Europe and America.
      <p>In 1987, 1989 and 1992, I spent a total of five months as an uchi deshi of Saito Sensei in Iwama. I founded
        Aikidō of Motueka (1987) and Nelson (1988) with my partner Martin Hartman.

      <p>I’m a mother of two grown up sons, love dancing, singing, yoga, skiing, and am the co-founder of the
        Empowerment Trust New Zealand.

      <p>I started my journey in aikidō in 1995 at the Nelson Dojo under Senseis Martin Hartman and Tim Soar. In 1997 I
        had the privilege of attending Saito Sensei’s Sydney gasshuku which really opened my eyes to the world of
        Aikido.</p>
      <p>I enjoy the budō and traditional Japanese aspects of aikidō and being able to test yourself and your body
        limits through physical training.</p>
      <p>Since taking up the position of instructor, I have found a new focus and avenue to my aikidō and enjoy watching
        others learn and grow in aikidō just about as much as I enjoy practicing it myself.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I began training aikidō in Switzerland 1978 under Ikeda Sensei and studied with many of the first generation
        Aikikai Sensei, such as Tada, Tamura and Tissier. Iwama Style became my passion after being Uchi Deshi at the
        Aikidō Institute of Oakland. I went to Iwama several times for longer periods to study under Saito Sensei, and
        kept a close relationship with him until his passing. We then affiliated with Aikidō Shinryukan, the NZ Aikikai
        Organisation.</p>
      <p>I immigrated to New Zealand in 1987, and founded the Nelson and Motueka Dōjō with Cornelia Baumgartner.</p>
