    <h1 id="getting_started">Getting started with aikidō</h1>

    <p>Whether you are an adult or a child, man or woman, mature or young, whether you are looking for fun, fitness or
      for self-defense, you are welcome to come along and watch any of our aikidō classes.</p>

    <p>Better still, come along prepared to give aikidō a try. The first class you train in is free.</p>

    <p>Everyone you see training on the mat, including the expert teacher, was once a beginner just like you. They
      remember their own first aikidō session.</p>
